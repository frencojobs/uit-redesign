    <h3>M.C.Tech (Embedded System)</h3>
    <p>
      The UIT Campus aims to offer a broad range of Master Degree Program.
      Currently,it also offers Master of Computer Technology for Embedded System
      Courses for 2017-2018 academic year and 2018-2019 academic year. Master's
      candidates are required to have minimum credit, 20 credits (mandatorily

        candidates may choose three courses from the following elective courses:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>KE-601:Computational Intelligence</li>
        <li>SE-601: Systems of Systems Engineering</li>
        <li>CM-602: Applied Combinatorics</li>
        <li>CN-504: Network Security & Resilience</li>
        <li>HPC-504: Mobile Cloud and The Internet of Things</li>
        <li>CN-405: Cryptographic Techniques & Data Security</li>
        <li>
