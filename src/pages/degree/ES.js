    <h3>Embedded Systems</h3>
    <p>
      Embedded System specialization program encompasses the study of hardware,
      software, and systems questions that arise in the design, development, and
      application of computers and embedded systems. Specifically, computer
      technology students specialized in Embedded System will have a knowledge
      of hardware systems (electrical networks, electronics, and VLSI); a
      knowledge of software systems (algorithms, data structures, and operating
      systems); and a knowledge of how these two domains interact (digital
      logic, signal and system theory, computer architectural and performance
      analysis). Embedded System students will learn about everything that goes
      into digital and computing systems, to CMOS VLSI design, to computer
      architecture, to programming, and from operating systems to compiler and
      language theory.
