    <h3>M.C.Sc (High Performance Computing)</h3>
    <p>
      The UIT Campus aims to offer a broad range of Master Degree Program.
      Currently,it also offers Master of Computer Science for High Performance
      Computing for 2017-2018 academic year and 2018-2019 academic year.
      Master's candidates are required to have minimum credit, 20 credits
      (mandatorily taking 10 courses and doing a thesis). The candidates must
