    <h3>Computer Systems</h3>
    <p>
      The objective of B.C.Tech. (Computer System) is to prepare graduates with
      the skills necessary to enter careers in the design, application,
      development, implementation, and support of computer systems. Computer
      System specialization focuses on the knowledge of engineering,
      mathematical analysis and computer science to develop, test and evaluate
      circuits, software, personal computers and more. The most important
      destination is not simply to engineer computer technology, but to
      understand how that technology fits into the larger scheme of the
      professional and personal needs. Coursework will cover topics such as
      software design, electronic circuits, communication and technology
      integration.
